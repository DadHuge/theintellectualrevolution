		<h1>The Intellectual Revolution</h1>
		<p>The digital age, 24/7 news channels, and paid opinion "thinkers" have provided a platform for zealots and dogmatists.</p>
		<p>They are using these platforms to undermine intellectualism and the scientific method; dividing us into tribes.</p>
		<p>These divisios have created the conditions for these extremists to rise into power.</p>
		<p>You can see it through the Republican Party's embrace of anti-democratic principles.<br>The Democratic Party's (and media's) undermining of the 2016 election by focusing on the Russia falsehood.<br>The destruction of American cities during the race riots of 2020 and dogmatic response to the violence.<br>The rejection of merit in American Universities, once the bastions of intellectualism.<br>The rise of Anti-racism and Systemic Racism.<br>The ACLU's embrace of leftist ideology.<br>The leftist embrace of "Jim Crow 2.0" voting restricitons signed into law in Republican states.<br>Cancel cultures chilling effect on our First Amendment throughout society.</p>
		<p>This is not the first time in history zealots have used their influence to gain their desired outcomes.</p>
		<p>The only solution to a close mind is an open one.  Welcome to the Intellectual Revolution.</p>
		<p>Embrace your intellect.</p>
